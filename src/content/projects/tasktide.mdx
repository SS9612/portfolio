title: "TaskTide Case Study"
---

## Overview
TaskTide is a kanban-style task manager focused on fast interactions and collaboration.
The goal was to ship a delightful, responsive UI with low operational overhead.

## Highlights
- Optimistic UI updates with server reconciliation
- Realtime presence and board updates
- Zero-config deployments and preview environments

## Architecture
Frontend uses React with server-rendered routes. Data layer abstracts network retries and
serialization. Below is a simplified example of an optimistic update pattern:

```ts
async function addCard(columnId: string, title: string) {
  const tempId = `temp-${Date.now()}`;
  boardState.addLocal({ id: tempId, columnId, title });
  try {
    const created = await api.createCard({ columnId, title });
    boardState.replace(tempId, created);
  } catch (err) {
    boardState.remove(tempId);
    throw err;
  }
}
```

> Notes: Optimistic UIs dramatically improve perceived performance but require careful
> error recovery and idempotent server handlers.
